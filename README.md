# CaptionPositions add-on for Vaadin

`CaptionPositions` is a layout extension add-on for Vaadin 7 and Vaadin 8.

*Disclaimer: I have only tested it with Vaadin 8. Please add an issue if it doesn’t work with Vaadin 7.*

It allows you to position the caption element of individual components inside `VerticalLayout` or `HorizontalLayout` to be either “top”, “right”, “bottom” or ”left”. It keeps any extra caption decorations (such as required field or error indicators) together with the caption (unline `FormLayout` for example, which moves the error indicator after the field).

```java
VerticalLayout layout = new VerticalLayout();
CaptionPositions captionPositions = new CaptionPositions(layout);
captionPositions.setCaptionPosition(component, CaptionPosition.LEFT);
```
